# NMED3720-Headliners

*Headliners* is a randomly generating static site created for [uLeth's](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/) "The Dynamic Web" course during the Fall 2023 semester. The site agrogates news articles from multiple sources, making it the only news source you need. This site will provide you with the most relevant, ground breaking reporting that covers both sides of the political spectrum, meaning you will always be informed. 

Okay, so maybe that's a lie. That said, the site genuinely is randomly generated. Beyond the shuffling of articles that occurs whenever a user loads the page, the page elements themselves are randomised at build time. Depending on when the page was built, you could find wildly different combinations of garbage and actual reporting. But at least there *is* actual news in the pile; you just need to dig for it.
